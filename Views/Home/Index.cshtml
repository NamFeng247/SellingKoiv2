            <h3>What is Koi?</h3>
            <p>Koi (鯉) or more specifically nishikigoi (錦鯉), are colored varieties of Amur carp that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. Koi is an informal name for the colored variants of C. rubrofuscus that have been selectively bred for color. They are also known as "living jewels".</p>
